# Humorous Cookie Consent Popup

## Description
In this Scrimba Front-End Developer Program guided project, I developed a satirical "Cookie Consent" popup window that humorously demands user information. The project is not only a parody but also a demonstration of various JavaScript and CSS concepts in action.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Learnings
- Implemented `setTimeout` to simulate a delay before the popup appears.
- Manipulated `element.style` directly in JavaScript to dynamically change styles.
- Worked with HTML forms to handle user inputs.
- Retrieved form data using `FormData` and `.get()` methods for processing.
- Prevented default form submission behavior with `event.preventDefault`.
- Used `flex-direction: row-reverse` in CSS to alter the layout.
- Toggled CSS classes from JavaScript to switch between styles.
- Controlled form elements' state using the `disabled` attribute.

## Setup
Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your web browser to engage with the mock cookie consent form.
